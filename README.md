# HSK-Testing-App

This is a basic app I wrote on a plane to China. 

It has a couple of cards, but still needs a decent amount of vocabulary. 

# How it works

- Shows a chinese character
- Give you an option to show the pinyin
- Give you an option to show the definition

No grading or anything fancy. Feel free to extend it yourself.
